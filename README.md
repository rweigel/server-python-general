# Overview

This is the start of a Python HAPI server that uses FastAPI and an OpenAPI specification and provides many of the options on the [`Java`](https://github.com/hapi-server/server-java) and [`NodeJS`](https://github.com/hapi-server/server-nodejs) generic HAPI servers. It is an alternative to the existing [Python HAPI server](https://github.com/hapi-server/server-python), which does not have many of features of the Java and NodeJS generic HAPI servers.

See https://github.com/rweigel/server-python-general-psws for example usage.
